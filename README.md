# HMAC Java Python Hashing
HMAC SHA256 hash generation in Java and Python

## Problem: 
I had code in Python that was generating hash code using HMAC SHA265 that is need to be refactored into Java

## Solution:
Gone through different stackoverflow Q&A and formulated the code in Java to produce the same hash code. Code is in HMAC.java

The calculated hash code of `This is the hash message` with key `This is the secret` in base64 string is `KNQ4jcjNbLkoZ0dY4n4yIQv8nHwU2ZvbB1YRN3f9CYI=`.
